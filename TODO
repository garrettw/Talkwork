todo:

- write the new Router
- CLInput->args is broken for now -- make it work
- standardize autoloader behavior for dbal and dice
- ditch existing Error class for a proper Exception class
- move all database-y stuff to use Doctrine DBAL...
- ... once I get its position in the directory structure right.
- do something with that old Hooks class, if I even need it.
- write more tests?

Long-term goals:
 - SSO support for bridging with many major CMSes (and maybe their plugins too!)
 - Modules for: static pages, blog, forums, wiki, e-commerce
