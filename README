Talkwork is (read: will be) a website framework and CMS that runs on PHP 5,
MySQL, and Apache, and is grounded in modularity, ease of code navigation,
versatility, and speed.

This project is in the pre-alpha stage of development (i.e. in the womb).

The name was actually generated by Wordoid (which I discovered thanks to Chris
Pirillo), and I liked it enough to contrive a meaning for it: it is a framework
to facilitate communication (or "talk").
Yeah, I know it's weak. You got a better idea? Talk to me.

I'd love any help I can get (partly because I just have a desire to work with
somebody on this).

Immediate goals:
 - Finish support for custom URL shortcuts (e.g. /module/controller/ -> /mc/ )
 - Finish pwhash() so functions.inc.php can be committed

Long-term goals:
 - SSO support for bridging with many major CMSes
 - Modules for: static pages, blog, forums, wiki, download center
